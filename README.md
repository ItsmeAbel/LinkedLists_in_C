# LinkedLists_in_C
Last assignment in the computer engineering course(DVGA03) at Karlstad University. The assignment aims to create and manage a linked list without using prebuilt c libraries. I've learned many things in this assignment including how to use a pointer in c to access memory and how to compile using makefile.
